The user of the app opens the app and registers as a new user and his/her details are stored on google firebase database.
When the user wants to login, the authentication is handled by firebase.
When logged in, the user sees a calenderview and can select a date. 
When a date is selected, an activity(View Event Activity) opens for the user to input an event for a particular day,
A floating action button for save is clicked and the event is saved for that particular day locally and also on the firebase database.
An event for a particular day can be edited and saved both locally and online on the firebase database.
After the event is saved it can be deleted. And it will be deleted on both the local and online database.
The UI is very simple to use and easy to understand.
